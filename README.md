# Pareto-Chart-bar-line-graph-in-Python-Language
Applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) in ABC Inventory Classification using Python & Matplotlib

📌 Project Overview:-

This project applies the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) through ABC Analysis to classify inventory items based on their annual consumption value.

Using Python (Matplotlib), a Pareto Chart is generated to visualize how a small portion of items drive the majority of inventory value.


🎯 Purpose:-

The purpose of this project is to prioritize inventory management by focusing on the vital few (A items) instead of the trivial many (C items).

This approach enables businesses to:

Optimize stock levels.

Reduce carrying costs.

Improve decision-making with clear visualization.


📌 Project Objective:-

To implement ABC Analysis using Pareto Chart visualization. 


🛠️ Tech Stack:-

Python 3

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Pandas (for data handling, optional)


Methodology:-

Calculate % contribution of each product to total value.

Compute cumulative % to classify into A, B, C categories.



Generate Pareto Chart:-

Bars → individual contributions.

Line → cumulative percentage.



Apply ABC classification:-

A items (P1–P3): Together make ~63% of value.

B items (P4–P6): Together take cumulative to ~87%.

C items (P7–P10): Contribute the remaining ~13%.




Visualization:-

✔ Pareto Chart with highlighted A (green), B (orange), C (gray) items.

✔ Custom legend with transparency, rounded corners, and shadow effects.

✔ A Pareto chart is a bar graph + line graph:

✔ Bars show individual item contribution (sorted from highest to lowest).

✔ Line shows cumulative percentage.




Future Enhancements:-

Automate ABC classification for larger datasets.

Add interactive Pareto charts using Plotly/Seaborn.

Integrate with inventory management systems.


In Use Cases:-

Inventory Management

Supply Chain Optimization

Business Analytics

Cost Control & Financial Planning
