# Pareto-Chart-bar-line-graph-in-Python-Language
Applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) in ABC Inventory Classification using Python & Matplotlib

📌 Project Overview:-
This project applies the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) through ABC Analysis to classify inventory items based on their annual consumption value.
Using Python (Matplotlib), a Pareto Chart is generated to visualize how a small portion of items drive the majority of inventory value.


🎯 Purpose:-
The purpose of this project is to prioritize inventory management by focusing on the vital few (A items) instead of the trivial many (C items).

This approach enables businesses to:
Optimize stock levels.
Reduce carrying costs.
Improve decision-making with clear visualization.


📌 Project Objective:-
To implement ABC Analysis using Pareto Chart visualization. 


🛠️ Tech Stack:-
Python 3
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Pandas (for data handling, optional)


Methodology:-
Calculate % contribution of each product to total value.
Compute cumulative % to classify into A, B, C categories.



Generate Pareto Chart:-
Bars → individual contributions.
Line → cumulative percentage.



Apply ABC classification:-
A items (P1–P3): Together make ~63% of value.
B items (P4–P6): Together take cumulative to ~87%.
C items (P7–P10): Contribute the remaining ~13%.

Visualization:-
✔ Pareto Chart with highlighted A (green), B (orange), C (gray) items.
✔ Custom legend with transparency, rounded corners, and shadow effects.
✔ A Pareto chart is a bar graph + line graph:
✔ Bars show individual item contribution (sorted from highest to lowest).
✔ Line shows cumulative percentage.



Why Pareto + ABC Analysis Matters
In inventory systems, 10–30% of items often account for 70–80% of the value.
Traditional “equal attention” inventory management wastes resources.
Pareto-based ABC analysis ensures managers focus where it matters most.
This project provides both analytical clarity (numbers, percentages) and visual clarity (Pareto chart) to support informed decision-making.




Future Enhancements:-
Automate ABC classification for larger datasets.
Add interactive Pareto charts using Plotly/Seaborn.
Integrate with inventory management systems.


In Use Cases:-
Inventory Management
Supply Chain Optimization
Business Analytics
Cost Control & Financial Planning
